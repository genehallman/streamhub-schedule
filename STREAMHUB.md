## See it in Action

Notable talks, parties, and other events are shown on a schedule for each of 5 days, and users can click on any event to leave a comment and read event-specific aggregated tweets and photos.

During the Conference, users could see the StreamHub Heat Index of any trending event, and the hottest event and its social content were featured to the left of the schedule.
